		<h2>Legal Experience</h2>
		
		<p>In addition to handling many thousands of individual claims, Sullivan Papain Block McGrath & Cannavo P.C. is either currently serving or has successfully served as Lead Plaintiffâ€™s Counsel in cases involving: 9/11 rescue and recovery workers litigation, Kaltech chemical explosion, 1993 World Trade Center bombing, HIV-infected hemophiliacs, Washington Square Park crash, Staten Island tank explosion, MGM Grand hotel fire, and the Anne Street explosion.</p>

		<p>SPBMC was one of only six firms in the country to represent the State of New York in its litigation against the major tobacco companies. Our efforts helped the state to obtain an historic $25 Billion recovery and unprecedented public health benefits which are expected to save thousands of lives</p>

		<p>The firm also had the honor of representing the families of 363 brave firefighters who gave up their lives on 9/11. We secured more than $265 Million for the families and we did not charge any legal fee.</p>
		
		<p>We represented more than 600 heroic firefighters sickened by exposures at the World Trade Center disaster site. As Co-Liaison Counsel, we assumed a leading role in the World Trade Center Disaster Site Litigation. After a long and difficult fight to obtain compensation for all of these brave individuals, on the eve of trial we helped secure a more than $600 Million settlement.</p>

		<p>Our success in these areas shows that no litigation is too large or complex for us to handle. Yet we have never lost sight of the fact that each client deserves the individual and personal care and attention which is a hallmark of our practice.</p>

		<p>Our verdicts and recoveries speak for themselves and are consistently among the highest in the State. In the last 10 years, we have recovered over $2 Billion for individuals injured and for families of those who have died due to the wrongful acts of others.</p>
